# Modern Testing Principles

1. We focus on improving the business.
2. We identify, prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks to accelerate the team.
3. We support the team's continuous improvement.
4. We coach the team to care about quality and testability.
5. We believe the customer is the best judge of our product's quality.
6. We use data to validate hypothesis and understand customer journeys.
7. We share testing know-how across the team (to the point we no longer need a dedicated tester).
